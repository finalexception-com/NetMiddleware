# Example Web API with Throttling Middleware

This is a sample ASP.NET Core Web API application showcasing how to implement middleware to throttle incoming requests. The middleware limits the rate of requests from each IP address to prevent overloading the server, following the approach described in [Understanding Middleware in .NET Core](https://finalexception.com/understanding-middleware-in-net-core/).

## Features
- Throttling middleware limits requests per IP within a defined timeframe.
- Demonstrates setting up and configuring middleware in ASP.NET Core.

This application provides a practical example of integrating custom middleware in a .NET Core application, with a focus on managing HTTP request flow and enhancing application performance and security.
